    <h2>what is Beluga Whale</h2>
    <p>
        The beluga whale (/bɪˈluːɡə/;[4] Delphinapterus leucas) is an <a href="/nothing">and</a> sub-Arctic cetacean. It
        is one of two
        members of the family Monodontidae, along with the narwhal, and the only member of the genus Delphinapterus. It
        is also known as the white whale, as it is the only cetacean to regularly occur with this colour; the sea
        canary, due to its high-pitched calls; and the melonhead, though that more commonly refers to the melon-headed
        whale, which is an oceanic dolphin.

        The beluga is adapted to life in the Arctic, with anatomical and physiological characteristics that
        differentiate it from other cetaceans. Amongst these are its all-white colour and the absence of a dorsal fin,
        which allows it to swim under ice with ease.[5] It possesses a distinctive protuberance at the front of its head
        which houses an echolocation organ called the melon, which in this species is large and deformable. The beluga's
        body size is between that of a dolphin and a true whale, with males growing up to 5.5 m (18 ft) long and
        weighing up to 1,600 kg (3,530 lb). This whale has a stocky body. Like many cetaceans, a large percentage of its
        weight is blubber (subcutaneous fat). Its sense of hearing is highly developed and its echolocation allows it to
        move about and find breathing holes under sheet ice.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>longevity</h3>
    <p>
        Its body is round, particularly when well fed, and tapers less smoothly to the head than the tail. The sudden
        tapering to the base of its neck gives it the appearance of shoulders, unique among cetaceans. The tail-fin
        grows and becomes increasingly and ornately curved as the animal ages. The flippers are broad and short—making
        them almost square-shaped.

    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <h3>Social structure and play</h3>
    <p>
        These cetaceans are highly sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain between two
        and 25 individuals, with an average of 10 members.[61] Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to
        move from pod to pod. Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days be
        hundreds of miles away from that pod.[62] Beluga whale pods can be grouped into three categories, nurseries
        (which consist of mother and calves), bachelors (which consist of all males) and mixed groups. Mixed groups
        contain animals of both sexes.[63][50] Many hundreds and even thousands of individuals can be present when the
        pods join in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total
        population and is when they are most vulnerable to being hunted.[64]
